# IACDT

It All Comes Down to This, or IACDT for short, is a project I've decided to work on due to the many request of the creation of a Manhunt plugin for streamer events or for friends for the fun of it.

To be honest, I kinda got sick of creating the same thing over again, except with different things (laugh, it's funny), so here's where I'll be putting my foot down and give you this.

This project is still in development. Expect Bugs, Errors, and other malfuctions with the plugin. Please, do not rate/review the plugin with a "bad" or a question and proceed to give it one star. Use the Issues page here to report them.
